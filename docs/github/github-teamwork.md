GitHub and teamwork
===================

GitHub makes collaboration easy. You can [invite other users to work on your project](#sharing-your-repository-with-other-users) or [contribute to their repositories](#contributing-to-another-users-repository).

## Adding a branch protection rule

If you don't want others to be able to update your main branch without your approval, you need to set up a branch protection rule. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository page on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings**.
  ![The repository settings button](../../static/img/figures/github-settings.jpg)
4. In the menu on the left, click **Branches**.
5. Next to **Branch protection** rules, click **Add rule**.
6. Under **Branch name pattern**, enter the name of the branch you want to protect, for instance *main*.
7. Under **Protect matching branches**, tick **Require pull request reviews before merging**.

If you want to let other GitHub users contribute to your repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to your repository page on GitHub and click **Settings**.
